Argus 5.0
Open Argus
http://openargus.org

This directory contains source code for Argus, an IP network
transaction auditing tool, that generates comprehensive network flow
data from a network traffic stream. Argus strives to be the advanced
network flow data generator, capturing more network traffic features
than other systems. The primary design goal of Argus is to generate
network traffic audit data to enable leading edge network analysis,
include modern AI/ML strategies, for any scale needed.

The data that Argus generates has been used for a wide range of tasks
including Network Operations, Security, Assurance and Performance
Monitoring and Management, with an emphasis on network traffic auditing
and forensics analysis.  It is designed to generate network status
data suitable for real-time network situtional awareness as well as
historic analysis, to enable network baseline development, and anomaly
detection strategies for network operations, performance and cyber
security.

This package contains the network activity sensor, that takes in
raw packet data, from either a file or from the network, and generates
network flow activity status records.  Argus is comprehensive, in
that it accounts for all network activity, not just IP (Layer 3) traffic.

Use the accompaning argus-clients-5.0.0 tools to collect,
process, print, graph, store, process, analyze, archive and manage
the data that Argus generates.

To install the software and get started, see the ./INSTALL file.
For answers to many questions, please see the argus web site
at http://qosient.com/argus.

The Argus 5.0 has been ported to MacOS, Windows, SunOS, Solaris,
Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, BSD Unix, AIX, HPUX, Irix, Onix,
UniCos, VxWorks, Cygwin and OpenWRT, to name just a few, and the
argus client software has been successfully used under most if not all
the same platforms.  If you port Argus to another system, please
let us know on the mailing list.


************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Please send problems, bug reports, questions and comments to the argus
mailing list at Carnegie Mellon University:

   argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

We encourage you to  use the './bin/argusbug' script when posting
bug reports about Argus. Argusbug will gather some information about
your system and start your editor with a form in which you can
describe your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-
relevant to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug
may  be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use
consider using the tool.  

Email that reports that 'Argus does not work.  Why?' will
be completely ignored.

************************************************************


Argus is the first netflow technology, started in 1984 at Georgia
Tech, and adapted for cyber security operations in 1991 at Carengie
Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute.  While it has
a long history, we still think of argus as innovative and leading
edge.  Comprehensive network transaction auditing is an extremely
powerful network management tool, and a large number of sites do
 benefit from the prototype work that has been done through the
Argus Project.

Again, thank you for your interest in Argus.  I hope that you find
the software useful.
