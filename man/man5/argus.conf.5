.SH NAME
\fBargus.conf\fP \- \fBargus\fP resource file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B argus.conf
.SH COPYRIGHT
Copyright (c) 2000-2015 QoSient, LLC   All rights reserved.
.SH DESCRIPTION

This is the canonical argus configuration file.  All options that
argus supports can be turned on or modified using this configuration
format.  Argus will search for a system /etc/argus.conf file and will open
it and use it to seed all configuration options.conf.  Previous versions
of Argus supported searching for argus.conf in $ARGUSPATH, $ARGUSHOME,
$ARGUSHOME/lib, $HOME, and $HOME/lib, but this support is deprecated.
All values in this file can be overriden by command line options, or other
configuration files of this format when specified in using the -F option.

Argus will read any number of configuration files using the -F option,
and command-line order is very important.

.SH Variable Syntax

Variable assignments must be of the form:
.nf
  VARIABLE=
.fi
with no white space between the VARIABLE and the '=' sign.
Quotes are optional for string arguments, but if you want
to embed comments, then quotes are required.

.SH ARGUS_FLOW_TYPE / ARGUS_FLOW_KEY

The Argus can be configured to support a large number of
flow types.  The Argus can provide either type, i.e.
uni-directional or bi-directional flow tracking and
the flow can be further defined by specifying the key.
The argus supports a set of well known key strategies,
such as 'CLASSIC_5_TUPLE', 'LAYER_3_MATRIX', 'LAYER_2_MATRIX',
'MPLS', and/or 'VLAN', or the argus can be configured to
formulate key strategies from a list of the specific
objects that the Argus understands.  See the man page for
a complete description.

The default is the classic 5-tuple IP flow, CLASSIC_5_TUPLE.

There is no commandline equivalent.

.nf
\fBARGUS_FLOW_TYPE=\fP"Bidirectional"
\fBARGUS_FLOW_KEY=\fP"CLASSIC_5_TUPLE"
.fi


.SH ARGUS_DAEMON

Argus is capable of running as a daemon, doing all the right things
that daemons do.  When this configuration is used for the system
daemon process, say for /etc/argus.conf, this variable should be
set to "yes".

In the examples seen in the ./support/Startup/argus scripts,
this value is set to "yes", as the system startup strategy 
requires the program to daemonize themselves, returning a value
to the system, hopefully quickly.  Some systems, however, want
to daemonize the tasks themselves, and those cases, the value
must be set to "no".

which requires that this variable be set to "yes".


The default value is to not run as a daemon.

Commandline equivalent  -d

\fBARGUS_DAEMON=\fPno


.SH ARGUS_MONITOR_ID

Argus Monitor Data is uniquely identifiable based on the source
identifier that is included in each output record.  This is to
allow you to work with Argus Data from multiple monitors at the
same time.  The ID is 32 bits long, and argus suppors a number of
formats as legitimate values. Argus support unsigned ints, IPv4
addresses and 4 bytes strings, as values.

The formats are discerned from the values provided.  Double-quoted
values are treated as strings, and are truncated to 4 characters.
Non-quoted values are tested for whether they are hostnames, and if
not, then they are tested wheter they are numbers.

The configuration allows for you to use host names, however, do
have some understanding how `hostname` will be resolved by the
nameserver before commiting to this strategy completely.

For convenience, argus supports the notion of "`hostname`" for
assigning the probe's id.  This is to support management of
large deployments, so you can have one argus.conf file that works
for a lot of probes.

For security, argus does not rely on system programs, like hostname.1.
It implements the logic of hostname itself, so don't try to run
arbitrary programs using this method, because it won't work.

Commandline equivalent   -e

.nf
\fBARGUS_MONITOR_ID\fP=`hostname`    // IPv4 address returned
\fBARGUS_MONITOR_ID\fP=10.2.45.3     // IPv4 address
\fBARGUS_MONITOR_ID\fP=2435          // Number
\fBARGUS_MONITOR_ID\fP="en0"         // String
.fi


.SH ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT

Argus monitors can provide a real-time remote access port
for collecting Argus data.  This is a TCP based port service and
the default port number is tcp/561, the "experimental monitor"
service.  This feature is disabled by default, and can be forced
off by setting it to zero (0).

When you do want to enable this service, 561 is a good choice,
as all ra* clients are configured to try this port by default.

Commandline equivalent  -P

\fBARGUS_ACCESS_PORT=\fP561


.SH ARGUS_BIND_IP

When remote access is enabled (see above), you can specify that Argus
should bind only to a specific IP address. This is useful, for example,
in restricting access to the local host, or binding to a private
interface while capturing from another.

You can provide multiple addresses, separated by commas, or on multiple
lines.

The default is to bind to any IP address.

Commandline equivalent  -B

.nf
\fBARGUS_BIND_IP=\fP"::1,127.0.0.1"
\fBARGUS_BIND_IP=\fP"127.0.0.1"
\fBARGUS_BIND_IP=\fP"192.168.0.68"
.fi


.SH ARGUS_INTERFACE

By default, Argus will open the first appropriate interface on a
system that it encounters.  For systems that have only one network
interface, this is a reasonable thing to do.  But, when there are
more than one suitable interface, you should specify the
interface(s) Argus should use either on the command line or in this
file.

Argus can track packets from any or all interfaces, concurrently.
The interfaces can be tracked as:
  1.  independant - this is where argus tracks flows from each
         interface independant from the packets seen on any other
         interface.  This is useful for hosts/routers that
         have full-duplex interfaces, and you want to distinguish
         flows based on their interface. There is an option to specify
         a distinct srcid to each independant modeler.

  2.  duplex - where argus tracks packets from 2 interfaces
         as if they were two half duplex streams of the same link.
         Because there is a single modeler tracking the 2
         interfaces, there is a single srcid that can be passed as
         an option.

  3.  bonded - where argus tracks packets from multiple interfaces
         as if they were from the same stream.  Because there is a
         single modeler tracking the 2 interfaces, there is a single
         srcid that can be passed as an option.

 Interfaces can be specified as groups using '[',']' notation, to build
 flexible definitions of packet sources.  However, each interface
 should be referenced only once (this is due to performance and OS
 limitations, so if your OS has no problem with this, go ahead).

 The lo (loopback) interface will be included only if it is specifically
 indicated in the option.

 The syntax for specifying this either on the command line or in this file:
    -i ind:all
    -i dup:en0,en1/srcid
    -i bond:en0,en1/srcid
    -i dup:[bond:en0,en1],en2/srcid
    -i en0/srcid -i en1/srcid  (equivalent '-i ind:en0/srcid,en1/srcid')
    -i en0 en1     (equivalent '-i bond:en0,en1')

 In all cases, if there is a "-e srcid" provided, this is used as the
 default.  If a srcid is specified using this option, it overrides
 the default.

 Srcid's are specified using the notion used for ARGUS_MONITOR_ID, as above.

Commandline equivalent   -i

.nf
\fBARGUS_INTERFACE\fP=any
\fBARGUS_INTERFACE\fP=ind:all
\fBARGUS_INTERFACE\fP=ind:en0/192.168.0.68,en2/192.168.2.1
\fBARGUS_INTERFACE\fP=ind:en0/"en0",en2/19234
\fBARGUS_INTERFACE\fP=en0
.fi


.SH ARGUS_GO_PROMISCUOUS

By default, Argus will put its interface in promiscuous mode
in order to monitor all the traffic that can be collected.
This can put an undo load on systems. 

If the intent is to monitor only the network activity of
the specific system, say to measure the performance of
an HTTP service or DNS service, you'll want to turn 
promiscuous mode off.

The default value goes into prmiscuous mode.

Commandline equivalent  -p

.nf
\fBARGUS_GO_PROMISCUOUS=\fPyes
.fi


.SH ARGUS_CHROOT_DIR

Argus supports chroot(2) in order to control the file system that
argus exists in and can access.  Generally used when argus is running
with privileges, this limits the negative impacts that argus could
inflict on its host machine.

This option will cause the output file names to be relative to this
directory, and so consider this when trying to find your output files.

Commandline equivalent   -c dir

.nf
\fBARGUS_CHROOT_DIR=\fP/chroot_dir
.fi


.SH ARGUS_SETUSER_ID

Argus can be directed to change its user id using the setuid() system
call.  This is can used when argus is started as root, in order to
access privileged resources, but then after the resources are opened,
this directive will cause argus to change its user id value to
a 'lesser' capable account.  Recommended when argus is running as
daemon.

Commandline equivalent   -u user

.nf
\fBARGUS_SETUSER_ID=\fPuser
.ni


.SH ARGUS_SETGROUP_ID

Argus can be directed to change its group id using the setgid() system
call.  This is can used when argus is started as root, in order to
access privileged resources, but then after the resources are opened,
this directive can be used to change argu's group id value to
a 'lesser' capable account.  Recommended when argus is running as
daemon.

Commandline equivalent   -g group

.nf
\fBARGUS_SETGROUP_ID=\fPgroup
.fi


.SH ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE

Argus can write its output to one or a number of files,
default limit is 5 concurrent files, each with their own
independant filters.

The format is:
.nf
     ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name
     ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name "filter"
.fi

Most sites will have argus write to a file, for reliablity 
and performance.  The example file name is used here as
supporting programs, such as ./support/Archive/argusarchive
are configured to use this file.

Commandline equivalent  -w

.nf
\fBARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=\fP/var/log/argus/argus.out
.fi


.SH ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM

Argus can write its output to one or a number of remote hosts.
The default limit is 5 concurrent output streams, each with their
own independant filters.

The format is:
     ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM="URI [filter]"
     ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAN="argus-udp://host:port 'tcp and not udp'"

Most sites will have argus listen() for remote sites to request
argus data, but for some sites and applications sending records without
registration is desired.  This option will cause argus to transmit records
that match the optional filter, to the configured targets using UDP as the
transport mechanism.

Commandline equivalent   -w argus-udp://host:port

.nf
\fBARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM=\fPargus-udp://224.0.20.21:561
.fi


.SH ARGUS_SET_PID

When Argus is configured to run as a daemon, with the -d
option, Argus can store its pid in a file, to aid in
managing the running daemon.  However, creating a system
pid file requires privileges that may not be appropriate
for all cases.

When configured to generate a pid file, if Argus cannot
create the pid file, it will fail to run.  This variable,
and the directory the pid is written to, is available to
override the default, in case this gets in your way.

The default value is to generate a pid.  The default 
path for the pid file, is '/var/run'.

No Commandline equivalent   

.nf
\fBARGUS_SET_PID=\fPyes
\fBARGUS_PID_PATH=\fP/var/run


.SH ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL

Argus will periodically report on a flow's activity every
ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL seconds, as long as there is
new activity on the flow.  This is so that you can get a
view into the activity of very long lived flows.  The default
is 60 seconds, but this number may be too low or too high
depending on your uses.

The default value is 60 seconds, but argus does support
a minimum value of 1.  This is very useful for doing
measurements in a controlled experimental environment
where the number of flows is < 1000.

Commandline equivalent  -S

\fBARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL=\fP60


.SH ARGUS_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL

Argus will periodically report on a its own health, providing
interface status, total packet and bytes counts, packet drop
rates, and flow oriented statistics.

These records can be used as "keep alives" for periods when
there is no network traffic to be monitored.

The default value is 300 seconds, but a value of 60 seconds is
very common.

Commandline equivalent  -M


\fBARGUS_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL=\fP300


.SH ARGUS_DEBUG_LEVEL

If compiled to support this option, Argus is capable of
generating a lot of debug information.

The default value is zero (0).

Commandline equivalent  -D

\fBARGUS_DEBUG_LEVEL=\fP0



.SH ARGUS_GENERATE_PACKET_SIZE

Argus can be configured to generate packet size information
on a per flow basis, which provides the max and min packet
size seen .  The default value is to not generate this data.

Commandline equivalent   -Z

.nf
\fBARGUS_GENERATE_PACKET_SIZE=\fPyes
.fi


.SH ARGUS_GENERATE_JITTER_DATA

Argus can be configured to generate packet jitter information
on a per flow basis.  The default value is to not generate
this data.

Commandline equivalent  -J

 
\fBARGUS_GENERATE_JITTER_DATA=\fPno


.SH ARGUS_GENERATE_MAC_DATA

Argus can be configured to not provide MAC addresses in
it audit data.  This is available if MAC address tracking
and audit is not a requirement.

The default value is to not generate this data.

Commandline equivalent  -m

.nf
\fBARGUS_GENERATE_MAC_DATA=\fPno
.fi


.SH ARGUS_GENERATE_APPBYTE_METRIC

Argus can be configured to generate metrics that include
the application byte counts as well as the packet count 
and byte counters.

Commandline equivalent  -A
 
.nf
\fBARGUS_GENERATE_APPBYTE_METRIC=\fPno
.fi


.SH ARGUS_GENERATE_TCP_PERF_METRIC

Argus by default, generates extended metrics for TCP
that include the connection setup time, window sizes,
base sequence numbers, and retransmission counters.
You can suppress this detailed information using this 
variable.

No commandline equivalent

.nf
\fBARGUS_GENERATE_TCP_PERF_METRIC=\fPyes
.fi

.SH ARGUS_GENERATE_BIDIRECTIONAL_TIMESTAMPS

Argus by default, generates a single pair of timestamps,
for the first and last packet seen on a given flow, during
the obseration period.  For bi-directional flows, this
results in loss of some information.  By setting this
variable to 'yes', argus will store start and ending
timestamps for both directions of the flow.

No commandline equivalent

.nf
\fBARGUS_GENERATE_BIDIRECTIONAL_TIMESTAMPS=\fPno
.fi

.SH ARGUS_CAPTURE_DATA_LEN

Argus can be configured to capture a number of user data
bytes from the packet stream.

The default value is to not generate this data.

Commandline equivalent  -U

 
\fBARGUS_CAPTURE_DATA_LEN=\fP0


.SH ARGUS_FILTER_OPTIMIZER

Argus uses the packet filter capabilities of libpcap.  If
there is a need to not use the libpcap filter optimizer,
you can turn it off here.  The default is to leave it on.

Commandline equivalent  -O


\fBARGUS_FILTER_OPTIMIZER=\fPyes


.SH ARGUS_FILTER

You can provide a filter expression here, if you like.
It should be limited to 2K in length.  The default is to
not filter.

No Commandline equivalent


\fBARGUS_FILTER=\fP""


.SH ARGUS_PACKET_CAPTURE_FILE

Argus allows you to capture packets in tcpdump() format
if the source of the packets is a tcpdump() formatted
file or live packet source.

Specify the path to the packet capture file here.

.nf
\fBARGUS_PACKET_CAPTURE_FILE=\fP"/var/log/argus/packet.out"
.fi


.SH ARGUS_SSF
Argus supports the use of SASL to provide strong 
authentication and confidentiality protection.

The policy that argus uses is controlled through
the use of a minimum and maximum allowable protection
strength, which is standard for SASL based appliations.
Set these variable to control this policy.  The default
is no security policy.

.nf
\fBARGUS_MIN_SSF=\fP0
\fBARGUS_MAX_SSF=\fP0
.fi


.SH ARGUS_PCAP_BUF_SIZE

Argus supports setting the pcap buffer size.
You can use the abbreviations K, M, G to specify
thousands, millions or billions of bytes.

.nf
\fBARGUS_PCAP_BUF_SIZE=\fP1G
.fi


.SH ARGUS_ENV

Argus supports setting environment variables to enable
functions required by the kernel or shared libraries.
This feature is intended to support libraries such as
the net pf_ring support for libpcap as supported by
code at http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/

Setting environment variables in this way does not affect
internal argus variable in any way. As a result, you
can't set ARGUS_PATH using this feature.

Care should must be taken to assure that the value given
the variable conform's to your systems putenv.3 system call.
You can have as many of these directives as you like.

The example below is intended to set a libpcap ring buffer
length to 300MB, if your system supports this feature.

.nf
\fBARGUS_ENV=\fP"PCAP_MEMORY=300000"
.fi


.SH ARGUS_TUNNEL_DISCOVERY

Argus can be configured to discover tunneling protocols
above the UDP transport header, specifically Teredo
(IPv6 over UDP).  The algorithm is simple and so, having
this on by default may generate false tunnel matching.

The default is to not turn this feature on.


.nf
\fBARGUS_TUNNEL_DISCOVERY=\fPno
.fi


.SH ARGUS_EVENT_DATA

Argus supports the generation of host originated processes
to gather additional data and statistics.  These include
periodic processes to poll for SNMP data, as an example, or
to collect host statistics through reading procfs().  Or
single run programs that run at a specified time.

These argus events, are generated from the complete list of
ARGUS_EVENT_DATA directives that are specified here.

.nf
The syntax is:
     Syntax is: "method:path|prog:interval[:postproc]"
         Where:  method = [ "file" | "prog" ]
               pathname | program = "%s"
               interval = %d[smhd] [ zero means run once ]
               postproc = [ "compress" | "compress2" ]


\fBARGUS_EVENT_DATA=\fP"file:/proc/vmstat:30s:compress"
\fBARGUS_EVENT_DATA=\fP"prog:/usr/local/bin/ralsof:30s:compress"
.fi


.SH ARGUS_KEYSTROKE


This version of Argus supports keystroke detection and counting for
TCP connections, with specific algorithmic support for SSH connections.

The ARGUS_KEYSTROKE variable turns the feature on. Values for
this variable are:
.nf
      \fBARGUS_KEYSTROKE=\fP"yes" - turn on TCP flow tracking
      \fBARGUS_KEYSTROKE=\fP"tcp" - turn on TCP flow tracking
      \fBARGUS_KEYSTROKE=\fP"ssh" - turn on SSH specific flow tracking
      \fBARGUS_KEYSTROKE=\fP"no"    [default]
.fi

The algorithm uses a number of variables, all of which can be
modifed using the ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF descriptor, which is a
semicolon (';') separated set of variable assignments.  Here is
the list of supported variables:
.nf
  \fBDC_MIN\fP  -   (int) Minimum client datagram payload size in bytes
  \fBDC_MAX\fP  -   (int) Maximum client datagram payload size in bytes
  \fBGS_MAX\fP  -   (int) Maximum server packet gap
  \fBDS_MIN\fP  -   (int) Minimum server datagram payload size in bytes
  \fBDS_MAX\fP  -   (int) Maximum server datagram payload size in bytes
  \fBIC_MIN\fP  -   (int) Minimum client interpacket arrival time (microseconds)
  \fBLCS_MAX\fP -   (int) Maximum something - Not sure what this is
  \fBGPC_MAX\fP -   (int) Maximum client packet gap
  \fBICR_MIN\fP - (float) Minimum client/server interpacket arrival ratio
  \fBICR_MAX\fP - (float) Maximum client/server interpacket arrival ratio
.fi

All variables have default values, this variable is used to override
those values.  The syntax for the variable is:
.nf
     ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF="DC_MIN=20;DS_MIN=20"

\fBARGUS_KEYSTROKE\fP="no"
\fBARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF\fP=""
