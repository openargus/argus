# Example  argus.conf
#
# Argus will open this argus.conf if its installed as /etc/argus.conf.
# It will also search for this file as argus.conf in directories
# specified in $ARGUSPATH, or $ARGUSHOME, $ARGUSHOME/lib,
# or $HOME, $HOME/lib, and parse it to set common configuration
# options.  All values in this file can be overriden by command
# line options, or other files of this format that can be read in
# using the -F option.
#
#
# Variable Syntax
# 
# Variable assignments must be of the form:
#
#   VARIABLE=value
#   VARIABLE="compound values"
#
# with no white space between the VARIABLE and the '=' sign.
#
#
# Comments
#
# Comments are supported using a '#' as the first character
# in the string, such as this string that you are reading.
# 
# Embedded comments are supported preceeded by a " //" as you
# see in the C language.  The preceeding white space is very important.
# The space or tab is absolutely required to delimit the end of the 
# variable values and the beginning of the comment.  Without the space,
# the comment will be included as a part of the configuration variable.
#
#   VARIABLE=value // comment
#   VARIABLE="compound values" // comment

# The Argus can be configured to support a large number of
# flow types.  The Argus can provide either type, i.e.
# uni-directional or bi-directional flow tracking and
# the flow can be further defined by specifying the key.
# The argus supports a set of well known key strategies,
# such as 'CLASSIC_5_TUPLE', 'LAYER_2', 'LAYER_2_MATRIX',
# 'LAYER_2_MATRIX', 'MPLS', and/or 'VLAN', or the argus can
# be configured to # formulate key strategies from a list of
# the specific objects that the Argus understands.  See the
# man page for a complete description.
#
# The default is the classic 5-tuple IP flow, CLASSIC_5_TUPLE.
#

ARGUS_FLOW_TYPE="Bidirectional"
ARGUS_FLOW_KEY="CLASSIC_5_TUPLE"

#ARGUS_FLOW_KEY="CLASSIC_5_TUPLE+LAYER_2"


# Argus is capable of running as a daemon, doing all the right things
# that daemons do.  When this configuration is used for the system
# daemon process, say for /etc/argus.conf, this variable should be
# set to "yes".
#
# In the examples seen in the ./support/Startup/argus scripts,
# this value is set to "yes", as the system startup strategy 
# requires the program to daemonize themselves, returning a value
# to the system, hopefully quickly.  Some systems, however, want
# to daemonize the tasks themselves, and those cases, the value
# must be set to "no".  
#
# The default value is to not run as a daemon.
#
# Commandline equivalent   -d

ARGUS_DAEMON=no


# Argus Monitor Data is uniquely identifiable based on the source
# identifier that is included in each output record.  This is to
# allow you to work with Argus Data from multiple monitors at the
# same time.  The ID is 32 bits long, and argus suppors a number of
# formats as legitimate values. Argus support unsigned ints, IPv4
# addresses and 4 bytes strings, as values.
#
# The formats are discerned from the values provided.  Double-quoted
# values are treated as strings, and are truncated to 4 characters.
# not, then they are tested wheter they are numbers.
#
# The configuration allows for you to use host names, however, do
# have some understanding how `hostname` will be resolved by the
# nameserver before commiting to this strategy completely.
#
# For convenience, argus supports the notion of "`hostname`" and
# "`hostuuid`" for assigning the probe's id.  This is to support 
# general management of larger deployments, so you can have one
# argus.conf file that works for a lot of probes.
#
# The use of `hostuuid` is targeted at Linux and Apple computers.
#
# With Argus V5 (gargoyle), the srcid formats are extended to include
# 64-bit values, designed primarily to provide interface identifiers,
# in addition to a 32-bit probe id, as well as to support IPv6 addresses
# as identifiers.  Interface string extensions are added when the keyword
# "inf" is added as the ARGUS_MONITOR_ID specifier.
#
# The syntax for the monitor id, srcid,  is:
#     [type:/]sid[/inf]
#        where type can be:
#           int, str, ipv4, ipv6, uuid
#
#        where sid can be:
#           int, "string", ipv4, ipv6, uuid
#
#        where inf is:
#           char[4]
#
# Examples include:
#   fe80::1
#   192.168.8.68
#   2345/en0
#   ipv4:/192.168.8.68/en1

# With Argus V5 (gargoyle), the srcid formats are extended to include

# support for 128-bit uuid's and IPv6 addrs, as well as interface identifiers.
# Interface string extensions are not added to ARGUS_MONITOR_ID specifier, unless
# you are hard coding the interface name for a specific observation domain,
# this is done int he ARGUS_INTERFACE specification.
# 
# To add the semantic that the default "mon0" is a part of this MONITOR_ID,

# Argus monitors can provide a real-time remote access port
# for collecting Argus data.  This is a TCP based port service and
# the default port number is tcp/561, the "experimental monitor"
# service.  This feature is disabled by default, and can be forced
# off by setting it to zero (0).
#
# When you do want to enable this service, 561 is a good choice,
# as all ra* clients are configured to try this port by default.
#
# Commandline equivalent   -P
#

ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT=562

# Port 562 would be used, if radium.1 is used to provide access on prot 561


# When remote access is enabled (see above), you can specify that Argus
# should bind only to a specific IP address. This is useful, for example,
# in restricting access to the local host, or binding to a private
# interface while capturing from another.
#
# You can provide multiple addresses, separated by commas, or on multiple
# lines.
#
# The default is to bind to any IP address.
#
# Commandline equivalent  -B
#

# By default, Argus will open the first appropriate interface on a
# system that it encounters.  For systems that have only one network
# interface, this is a reasonable thing to do.  But, when there are
# more than one suitable interface, you should specify the
# interface(s) Argus should use either on the command line or in this
# file.
#
# Argus can track packets from any or all interfaces, concurrently.
# The interfaces can be tracked as:
#   1.  independant - this is where argus tracks flows from each
#          interface independant from the packets seen on any other
#          interface.  This is useful for hosts/routers that
#          have full-duplex interfaces, and you want to distinguish
#          flows based on their interface. There is an option to specify
#          a distinct srcid to each independant modeler.
#
#   2.  duplex - where argus tracks packets from 2 interfaces
#          as if they were two half duplex streams of the same link.
#          Because there is a single modeler tracking the 2
#          interfaces, there is a single srcid that can be passed as
#          an option.
#
#   3.  bonded - where argus tracks packets from multiple interfaces
#          as if they were from the same stream.  Because there is a
#          single modeler tracking the 2 interfaces, there is a single
#          srcid that can be passed as an option.,
#
#   4.  parallel - hardware packet capture cards can be used to deliver
#          packets to a set of CPUs to gain highly parallel processing.  
#          The hardware strategy enables a set of argi to process a
#          single packet stream, independently, generating a collective
#          output that represents the flow record output of the single
#          stream.  Argus will need to spawn threads to open and process
#          a number of devices, and then merge the output to generate
#          a single time sorted flow output stream.
#
#  Interfaces can be specified as groups using '[',']' notation, to build
#  flexible definitions of packet sources.  However, each interface
#  should be referenced only once (this is due to performance and OS
#  limitations, so if your OS has no problem with this, go ahead).
#
#  The lo (loopback) interface will be included only if it is specifically
#  indicated in the option.
#
#  The syntax for specifying this either on the command line or in this file:
#     -i ind:all
#     -i dup:en0,en1/srcid
#     -i bond:en0,en1/srcid
#     -i para:en0,en1,en2/srcid
#     -i para:en[0...x]/srcid

#     -i dup:[bond:en0,en1],en2/srcid
#     -i en0/srcid -i en1/srcid            (equivalent '-i ind:en0/srcid,en1/srcid')
#     -i en0 en1                           (equivalent '-i bond:en0,en1')
#     -i en1(dlt)/srcid -i en1(dlt)/srcid
#
#  In all cases, if there is a "-e srcid" provided, the srcid provided is used
#  as the default.  If a srcid is specified using this option, it overrides
#  the default.
#
#  Srcid's are specified using the notion used for ARGUS_MONITOR_ID, as above.

# By default, Argus will put its interface in promiscuous mode
# in order to monitor all the traffic that can be collected.
# This can put an undo load on systems. 
 
# If the intent is to monitor only the network activity of

#
# The format is:
#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name
#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE="/full/path/file/name filter"
#
# Most sites will have argus write to a file, for reliablity.

#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM="argus-udp://multicastGroup:port
#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM="argus-udp://host:port 'tcp and not udp'"
#
# Most sites will have argus listen() for remote sites to request argus data, 
# using a "pull" data model, using Unix sockets.  Argus supports the use of
# TCP/IP sockets for remote delivery, by default, and UNIX_DOMAIN sockets
# for distribution within the OS, as an option.

#
#
# But for some sites and applications, pushing records without explicit registration
# is desired.  This option will cause argus to transmit records that match the
# optional filter, to the configured targets using UDP as the transport mechanism.
# 
# The primary purpose for this feature is to multicast argus records to
# a number of listeners on an interface, but it is not limited to this
# purpose. The multicast TTL is set to 128 by default, so that you can
# send records some distance.

# When Argus is configured to run as a daemon, with the -d
# option, Argus can store its pid in a file, to aid in

#
# When configured to generate a pid file, if Argus cannot
# create the pid file, it will fail to run.  This variable

# Argus will periodically report on a flow's activity every

# new activity on the flow.  This is so that you can get a
# multiple status reports into the activity of a flow.  The
# default is 5 seconds, but this number may be too low or
# too high depending on your uses.  Argus does suppport
# a minimum value of 0.000001 seconds.  Values under 1 sec
# are very useful for doing measurements in a controlled
# experimental environment where the number of flows is small.

# Commandline equivalent   -M
#

ARGUS_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL=5


# Argus has a number of flow cache timers that specify how long argus 
# will 'remember' the cache of idle flows.  When a flow cache is generated,
# it exists in the active flow status queue.  When the status interval is
# 'done', the flow is reported, and the flow cache is placed on a protocol
# specific timeout queue.  If new packets come in that match the flow cache,
# the cache is removed from the timeout queue, and placed back on the active
# status queue.  Flows can go through this cycle indefinately.
#
# If the flow cache remains idle for the protocol specific timeout period,
# Argus will delete the flow, and 'forget' any information that it may have
# observed for the flow.
# 
# The default values for specific protocols have been chosen to aggresively
# timeout flow caches for traditionally short lived flows to conserve memory
# utilization, and to provide retention of long lived flows, based on the
# average length of their idle period.  
#
# Increasing timeout values will have an impact on argus memory use, so
# take care when modifying values.
# 
# The maxium value for any timeout is 65534 seconds.

# single run programs that run at a specified time, or under
# certain conditions.
# 
# Events are programs that are run from argus itself, and
# its output is wrapped by an Argus Event message header and
# sent to the output collection.  
#
# When these programs are run is a matter of configuration,
# and the basic strategies are 1) single shot and 2) periodically.
# Some types of events are best run based on state changes.
# In particular are the events that provide network status awareness.
# Events that provide information, such as what is our current
# BSSID network (argus-airport), or what is our external IP address,
# (argus-extip), these can run periodically, but they would
# be best if run when there are network transitions, such as

# This version of Argus supports keystroke detection and counting for
# TCP connections, with specific algoritmic support for SSH connections.
#
# The ARGUS_KEYSTROKE variable turns the feature on. Values for
# this variable are:
# 	ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="yes" - turn on TCP flow tracking
# 	ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="tcp" - turn on TCP flow tracking
# 	ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="ssh" - turn on SSH specific flow tracking
# 	ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="no"	[default]
#
# The algorithm uses a number of variables, all of which can be
# modifed using the ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF descriptor, which is a
# semicolon (';') separated set of variable assignments.  Here is
# the list of supported variables:
#
#   DC_MIN  -   (int) Minimum client datagram payload size in bytes (48)
#   DC_MAX  -   (int) Maximum client datagram payload size in bytes (128)
#   GS_MAX  -   (int) Maximum server packet gap (3)
#   DS_MIN  -   (int) Minimum server datagram payload size in bytes (24)
#   DS_MAX  -   (int) Maximum server datagram payload size in bytes (256)
#   IC_MIN  -   (int) Minimum client interpacket arrival time (50000 microseconds)
#   LCS_MAX -   (int) Maximum something - Not sure what this is
#   GPC_MAX -   (int) Maximum client packet gap (3)
#   ICR_MIN - (float) Minimum client/server interpacket arrival ratio (0.816)
#   ICR_MAX - (float) Maximum client/server interpacket arrival ratio (1.122)
#
# All variables have default values, this variable is used to override
# those values.  The syntax for the variable is:
#
#      ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF="DC_MIN=20;DS_MIN=20"
#

ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="ssh"
ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF="DC_MIN=32;GPC_MAX=5"


# This version of Argus supports operating system fingerprinting through
# the inclusion of ARGUS_TCP_INIT DSRs in tcp flow reports.  Argus itself
# does not do the fingerprinting, ra* clients use the ARGUS_TCP_INIT DSR
# to fingerprint using pf.os or nmap like algorithms.

#ARGUS_OS_FINGERPRINTING="no"


# This version of Argus supports exporting hash values for each flow.

ARGUS_GENERATE_HASH_METRICS="yes"

# This version of Argus supports modifing the flow classification
# hash table size from the configuration file.

ARGUS_HASHTABLE_SIZE=4096
