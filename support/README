The files in these directories are sample configuration, system startup
scripts, filters, etc... to support the use of argus and its clients.
These files are simple examples, and may need to be modified to support
your specific system.  These files have been tested primarily on Linux.

Archive
   argusarchive - An sh shell script for moving the argus daemon's output
                  file into a date based archive.  The archive file
                  system is created when needed and the output file
                  is compressed and moved into the file system.

Config

                  that it can be imported by Microsoft's Excel.

                  with appropriate titles for the columns and a
                  date format that Excel understands.

                  issues that you may find important.
