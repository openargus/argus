QUICK MAKE

If all things are ready, distribution untarred, and you have libpcap
and bison installed on your system, you should be able to make
argus by simply typing:

   % ./configure
   % make

If you have any problems with this procedure, read further, if not
congratulations.  You can proceed to INSTALLATION.


DEPENDENCIES

The argus distribution is dependant on two public domain packages; libpcap,
which provides the argus server's portable packet capture interface, and flex/bison()
which are used for to build the filter compilers.  Both of these sets of
packages must be installed in order to compile argus.  Most versions of 
Linux/Unix/Mac OS X/xBSD have these packages installed by default, so 
hopefully it won't be a problem.

Below is the offical source of libpcap and current version:

libpcap-1.5.3
http://www.tcpdump.org/release/libpcap-1.5.3.tar.gz


The official site and current version of bison is:

bison-3.0.1
http://ftp.gnu.org/gun/bison/


And the offical site for Flex: The Fast Lexical Analyzer is:

flex-2.5.39
http://flex.sourceforge.net
http://sourceforge.net/projects/flex/files



Because argus is dependant on libpcap and flex/bison, you will need to
have them available prior to building the package.  Please refer to the
individual packages for installation instructions.  If you are not
interested in performing a system installtion for libpcap, then you
can simply untar libpcap in the same directory where you untared argus.
Argus's ./configure will find the package and use it accordingly.

For some operating systems, such as Fedora, you may have to install the
developement versions of some packages in order to get all the supporting
files.  On Fedora, the libpcap library is provided, however, compilers
etc... can't find the library at compile time.  Installing libpcap-devel
fixes this problem:

   yum install libpcap-devel
   apt-get install libpcap-devel

Argus supports block compression for some of its functions.  To support
this, argus will look for a usable zlib.  If not found, it will not
use the functions.

Argus can link to the public domain package tcp_wrappers to
provide remote access control.  At this time, the lastest version
is tcp_wrappers-7.6.  If tcp_wrappers in not installed on your
system, then installing this package in the same directory as
libpcap and argus is recommended.

Argus can also link to the cryptographic package SASL, the Simple
Authentication and Security Layer, which provides strong authentication
and wireline confidentiality for argus data.  Because of its features
and flexibility, we highly recommend using SASL, and becoming experienced
with its administration.

CONFIGURE

The program, ./configure, will scan the file system, looking for a lot
of things, including the libpcap and tcp_wrapper directories and libraries and
make assumptions about the platform which will allow ./configure to choose
between gcc, acc, cc, flex, lex, bison, yacc, pcre, sasl and where your specific
version of Perl.

If the libpcap or bison packages are not discovered, the ./configure
script will fail, as these packages are required.

Argus can be compiled with support for Sasl, to provide strong
authentication and confidentiality protection for data "on the wire".
This can be turned on using the option "--with-sasl[=DIR]".  If you do
not provide the optional directory, ./configure will guess where
sasl could be, using the standard installation directories as
a guide.

You can also specify that ./configure should not use gcc as the
compiler, which the default.  For Solaris, the sun c compiler is
much better for various reasons, and so providing the "--without-gcc"
option may generate more efficient code, when a native compiler
is available.

Configure will create links for the libpcap.a and libwrap.a libraries
in ./lib, and will create links to the distribution directories as
./libpcap and ./wrapper.  Configure will attempt to find the libpcap
and tcp_wrappers distribution directories, and their corresponding
libraries.  The path used to find these dependancies is ./libpcap,
./wrapper, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, ../libpcap, ../wrapper,
../tcp_wrappers, ../libpcap-[0-9]*.[0-9ab]*, and
../tcp_wrappers[-.][0-9]*.[0-9ab]*.

Because of major changes between tcp_wrappers-6 and tcp_wrappers-7,
./configure needs to discover the tcp_wrappers version number.  It
does this by scanning the patchlevel.h file in the tcp_wrapper
distribution, as a result, ./configure will attempt to find and then
establish a link to your tcp_wrappers distribution directory.

Again, we recommend that you install your libpcap and tcp_wrappers
distribution directories, or links to them, in either the same
directory as the Argus distribution, or as the directories
./libpcap and ./wrapper, in the Argus directory.



BUILDING ARGUS

So, after all that, to build Argus on a supported platform, first run
./configure.  ./configure will determine your system attributes and
generate subdirectories and the appropriate Makefiles from the Makefile.in
files found in the distribution.  After this, run "make".  If everything
goes well, appropriate libraries and binaries will be found in the ./bin
and ./lib subdirectories.  So, ....

   % ./configure
   % make

The argus will be found as ./bin/argus.

So, at this point you should have all the execuables needed.  But,
if you are having problems, it may be related to your compiler or
the flex and bison utilities.  So, ...

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build argus.  If your compiler
is not ANSI compliant, we highly recommend using the GNU C compiler,
available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc-*.tar.gz


Argus requires bison and flex.  For flex, version 2.4.6 or higher
is recommended.  The current version of flex and bison are available
via anonymous ftp:

        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/bison-*.tar.gz
        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/non-gnu/flex/flex-*.tar.gz


Now, if you are still having problems, ..., well its hard to say
from here what it might be.  So, you may want to send us some
mail.




INSTALLATION

QUICK INSTALL

If all things are well at this point, and you will be using
the installation strategy that we use, all you need do now
is:

   # make install

This will create the /usr/local/argus directory and move all
the binaries, supporting programs, man pages and
documenation into it.

If you are unsure about the standard installtion, run

   % make -n install

to review what make will try to do.  If you would like to
do something other than the standard install, then please
continue to read through this file.


If you are planning on running the argus as a persistant
daemon on your machine, then one additional step is recommended,
and that is setting up system wide argus configuration files;
/etc/argus.conf.conf.
 
   # cp ./support/Config/argus.conf /etc
 
You must edit /etc/argus.conf file for argus to work, as
the default configuration will have argus do a lot of work
but not output anything.

Argus writes its data either to an output file, or if you intend
argus to monitor traffic in realtime, to a socket port that client
programs can attach to.  You specify either, or both, in the
argus.conf file, by uncommenting the appropriate line.
 
At this point your ready to run the argus.

But if you wanted to do something different, then read on.

Argus does not have any installation retrictions, so you can
install Argus anywhere.  There are some conventions that have
been established, and I'll present them here, but you can, of
course, do your own thing.

I have found it useful to have an argus home directory to hold
the binaries, argus configuration files, the argus output file,
and hold my argus data archive.  If you would like to use this
strategy, create your directory, and create the environment
variable ARGUSHOME and set it to this directory.

I use /usr/local/argus.  I prefer putting the argus binary in
/usr/local/sbin (system binaries).

After making, as root, I just:

   # mkdir /usr/local/argus
   # cp bin/argusbug /usr/local/argus/bin
   # cp bin/argus /usr/local/sbin/argus

It is convenient to chmod argus so that it is "setuid root",
but many feel that this is a security problem, as any user
could then start an argus on the system.  Use this technique at
at your discretion.
 
   # chown root /usr/local/sbin/argus
   # chmod 4755 /usr/local/sbin/argus

Argus has a system configuration file that normally resides
as /etc/argus.conf.  You can install this file anywhere, but
the scripts that are provided in the ./support directory
will assume that the configuration is at /etc/argus.conf.

   # cp ./support/Config/argus.conf /etc/argus.conf

You will want to edit this file to choose values of your
liking.  The sample has all the common values set and is
a good suggestion.


Copying the man and doc directories is nice.
   
   # tar cf - doc man | (cd /usr/local/argus; tar xvpf -)


This should handle the basic installion.

Any comments, patches, bug reports or additions should be sent to 
argus@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.



PORTABILITY

Argus and its supporting routines have been developed on Sparc
architectures under SunOS 4.1.x and Solaris 2.7, and have been successfully
ported to Solaris, SGI, Ultrix, Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD platforms.
 
No claim is made as to the portability of Argus to other platforms, although
it is much easier now that we've addressed the big endian little endian
issues.  If you make any modifications to support installing and running
Argus in any other environment, please send us comments and/or patches.
We will be most grateful.


OPENWRT

Argus has been ported to OpenWrt, and a specific configure program is
provided to assist in making for OpenWrt.

First, untar the argus distribution into your OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package
directory.  Be sure that the libpcap library is installed in the
OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/staging_dir_mipsel/usr/lib, and your ready.

   % ./configure.openwrt
   % make

That should make an argus binary that can be installed on an openwrt system.
You will still need to provide an /etc/argus.conf file, and any type
of startup script to get argus going.


CYGWIN

Argus has been ported to Cygwin, the RedHat Linux environment for Windows.
Cygwin can be found at  http://www.cygwin.com. Install the latest version
of Cygwin, modifying the default install to include the developement support.

As noted above, you will need bison and flex and optionally tcpwrappers,
which are available for Cygwin.

On CYGWIN, the libpcap function is provided by the WinPcap Developers Pack.
The current version can be found at:

   http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm

Place the unzipped WpdPack folder in the same directory that you
untared argus, and the argus ./configure script will find it
and do the right thing.  At this point, to make argus:

   % ./configure
   % make

That should make an argus binary that can be installed as a Windows
service, using the cygrunsrv() program.  

Because interface names are so difficult to use on Windows, the Cygwin
port of argus allows you to specify an index for the interface you want
to monitor.  By running argus without an interface specification, argus
will print out the available interfaces, with thier indexes.  Use the
index number on the command line, or in the argus.conf file.

To setup argus as a system service under CYGWIN, use the cygrunsvc()
program.  Argus will write its output to /var/log/argus.log, so check
there is you have any problems.
